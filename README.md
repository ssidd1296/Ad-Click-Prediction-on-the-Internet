# Prediction-of-Clicking-on-Advertisement-on-Internet


-> In this project we are looking that whether a internet user will going to click on Advertisement which is shown on Internet.
-> Main objective of this project is to compare that which Machine Learning Algorithm performs better on this Advertisement dataset.

The Algorithms which we are using are as follows:-
1) Logistic Regression
2) K-Nearest Neighbour
3) Decision Tree
4) Random Forest
5) SVM

-> Confusion matrix and Classification report are used for evaluation of models.
