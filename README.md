# Ad-Click-Prediction-on-the-Internet

-> In this project we will predict that whether a user will click on adverts shown to him/her on the Internet. The main aim of this project is to compare the performance of various Machine Learning models better on this Advertisement dataset.

The Algorithms which we are using are as follows:-
1) Logistic Regression
2) K-Nearest Neighbour
3) Decision Tree
4) Random Forest
5) SVM

-> Confusion matrix and Classification report have been used as metrics for evaluation of the models.

- **Confusion Matrix of Random Forest**
